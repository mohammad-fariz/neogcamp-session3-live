    <h1>Mumbai's magnificence</h1>
    <h2>1. Gateway of India</h2>

    <h2>Gateway of India, the best place to visit in</h2>
    <p>was built in 1924 by George Willet to honor the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to <strong>Mumbai</strong>. Visit this place in the early morning or late evening hours to enjoy the cool breeze of the sea with your family sans the crowd. Located next to the iconic Taj Mahal Palace and facing the vast Arabian Sea, the Gateway of India leaves you spellbound in every way possible. Take a ferry ride offered here to experience a stupendous view of this monument right from the sea and you can also visit other main attractions nearby. </p>
